# Tibrary

## What is Tibrary?
It's a combination of the words Tiny and Library. But even as I type this, I think this title may be misleading. My intention is to have a Library of "Tiny" functions. I think it might be better described as a Library of "Simple" functions. But "Sibrary" does not sound the most optimistic. I actually now don't even know if I like the name... but I'm sticking to it.  

Anyway, all I wanted was a place to store little modules of code I use often.  
I doubt this is an original idea, lol  

Really, this is just for my own personal use, but I wanted to open it up to the public because maybe someone will stumble upon it and find it useful or maybe horrendous? You never know with the internet.

With that in mind, I tried to write the modules to be very newbie friendly.  
But maybe I'm crazy and I'm the only one who needs these kinda functions?
